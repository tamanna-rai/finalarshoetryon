## 🌌 About

This project is an exciting blend of **Augmented Reality (AR)** technology and **Shoe Fashion**, creating a **Virtual Try-On** experience. Powered by a state-of-the-art **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model, our system brings a unique and interactive way to try on shoes virtually. Inspired by the paper "AR Shoe: Real-Time Augmented Reality Shoe Try-on System on Smartphones," we developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that was showcased at the Datathon Vietnam competition.

## ✨ What is it?

Our project is an **AR Shoe Try-On System** that allows users to virtually try on shoes using their smartphones. The system uses AR technology to overlay shoes onto the user’s feet in real time, creating an immersive and interactive experience. This project is designed for anyone interested in the fusion of fashion and technology, particularly those in the retail or e-commerce industry looking to enhance customer engagement.
